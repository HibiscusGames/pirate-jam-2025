# Godot Configuration

These are some basic settings to get Godot to facilitate most workflows. This document is a work in progress.
Please share your improvements, especially with regards to your speciality, so everyone can benefit from them.

## General editor settings

These settings are useful for everyone.

### External Programs

Godot can delegate editing tasks to external programs. This is particularly useful for art workflows.

1. Open Godot and go to `Editor -> Editor Settings`
2. Navigate to `FileSystem -> External Programs`
3. Set your preferred programs for each task.
